\begin{frame}{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
\item Measured fractions of \Y1,2,3S originated from \chib decays.
About 40\% of $\Upsilon$ come from $\chi_b$, with mild dependence on $\Upsilon$ transverse momentum.
\item Measured mass of $\chi_b(3P)$ is 10507$\pm$2\mevcc, consistent with another determination which uses converted photons.
\end{itemize}

An LHCb internal note documenting this study has been written. The analysis is currently under 
internal review and will be the subject of an LHCb publication.
