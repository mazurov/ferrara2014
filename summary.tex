\begin{frame}{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
\item Measured fractions of \Y1,2,3S originated from \chib decays.
About 40\% of $\Upsilon$ come from $\chi_b$, with mild dependence on $\Upsilon$ transverse momentum.
\item This analysis improves significantly the statistical precision of the previous work and 
adds more decays and transverse momentum regions. The
\lhcb detector design allows to perform measurements in $\Upsilon$ rapidity and 
transverse momentum regions, which are complementary to the ones exploited 
by other LHC experiments.
\item Measured mass of $\chi_b(3P)$ is $10{,508}\pm2\stat\pm8\stat\mevcc$, consistent with another determination which uses converted photons.
\item A software profiling tool was developed.
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{}
The results on \chib production were regularly presented at the LHCb bottomonium working group,
an internal document was prepared by the author, is currently under review and will form 
the basis of a future LHCb publication.
