\begin{frame}{Systematic uncertainties}
Since this analysis measures the fraction of $\Upsilon(nS)$ particles
originating from $\chi_b$ decays, most systematic uncertainties cancel in the
ratio and only residual effects need to be taken into account. 

Systematic uncertainties on the event yields are mostly
due to the fit model of $\Upsilon$ and $\chi_b$ invariant masses, while the
ones on the efficiency are due to the photon reconstruction and the unknown
initial polarization of $\chi_b$ and $\Upsilon$ particles.
